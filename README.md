# Webstatus (needs a better name)
Checks the state of Internet connectivity periodically, and presents the results on a webpage.

It shows the current Internet status, and the percentage uptime for the last hour, day and week.

## Why?
Because my current Internet connection goes down frequently, and I wanted to find out how often and how long it happens.
